## Project Inception

Sometimes we have that pure and genuine connection with our journal, where we confide our deepest and truest secrets or our biggest and darkest fears. But what if keeping these thoughts in becomes too heavy? What if there is no one to share them with, or sharing them feels too scary? And what if sharing your stories, fears, and achievements could help and encourage others?

Imagine if there were a way to share your achievements safely and anonymously, without the fear of judgment. What if you didn't have to hold on to the weight of your experiences all by yourself? Journey allows you to safely let go of these burdens. Share your stories and connect with others in a meaningful way, all while maintaining your anonymity.

It's like a journey full of stories, strangers, and people we encounter on our way, whom we may never meet again. In your wanderings with strangers, sometimes your stories are the purest and truest, and they can be shared and left with strangers you will never meet again. We are wise and interesting, just sometimes too shy or lost to realize it. Talking things out is the best therapy, and Journey creates that space for us. 

Journey is for the lonely, shy, scared, silent, brave, radiant, energetic, and loving. Journey is for you.
